# Yves Bolong -- Junior developer learner  

My name is Yves as you already saw it. After 2 years in IT school, i have never reached my goal wich was to become a web developer. Then after many years of searching I heard about becode and Here I am.

## Here is a list of somme of my surprising skills

1. Doing matheamatics (don't ask me why)
2. Playing sudoku  
3. Building things.

## Another list of 3 things i like the most

- I love my children
- I love eating
- I really like Mathematics (and still don't ask me why)

During Becode, i would love to be independant, work on my own, be a *BEAST* in developement and at the find a really good job.

I don't have may fears but, the one in my head is not to achieve this goal again. the goal of becoming a developer.

At the end of this journey, i see my self in a big company practicing what i've learn and being the mos independant possible.

The Three things I value the most to work as a team are : Communication, Collaboration, TRuth and Respect.
